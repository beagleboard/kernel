Subject: [PATCH 16/67] iwlwifi: don't mess up the SCD when removing a key

commit d6ee27eb13beab94056e0de52d81220058ca2297 upstream.

When we remove a key, we put a key index which was supposed
to tell the fw that we are actually removing the key. But
instead the fw took that index as a valid index and messed
up the SRAM of the device.

This memory corruption on the device mangled the data of
the SCD. The impact on the user is that SCD queue 2 got
stuck after having removed keys.
The message is the log that was printed is:

Queue 2 stuck for 10000ms

This doesn't seem to fix the higher queues that get stuck
from time to time.
