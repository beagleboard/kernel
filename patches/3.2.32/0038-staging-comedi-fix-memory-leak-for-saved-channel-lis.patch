Subject: [PATCH 038/146] staging: comedi: fix memory leak for saved channel
 list

commit c8cad4c89ee3b15935c532210ae6ebb5c0a2734d upstream.

When `do_cmd_ioctl()` allocates memory for the kernel copy of a channel
list, it frees any previously allocated channel list in
`async->cmd.chanlist` and replaces it with the new one.  However, if the
device is ever removed (or "detached") the cleanup code in
`cleanup_device()` in "drivers.c" does not free this memory so it is
lost.

A sensible place to free the kernel copy of the channel list is in
`do_become_nonbusy()` as at that point the comedi asynchronous command
associated with the channel list is no longer valid.  Free the channel
list in `do_become_nonbusy()` instead of `do_cmd_ioctl()` and clear the
pointer to prevent it being freed more than once.

Note that `cleanup_device()` could be called at an inappropriate time
while the comedi device is open, but that's a separate bug not related
to this this patch.
