Subject: [PATCH 077/146] mtd: mtdpart: break it as soon as we parse out the
 partitions

commit c51803ddba10d80d9f246066802c6e359cf1d44c upstream.

We may cause a memory leak when the @types has more then one parser.

Take the `default_mtd_part_types` for example. The default_mtd_part_types has
two parsers now: `cmdlinepart` and `ofpart`.

Assume the following case:
The kernel command line sets the partitions like:
	#gpmi-nand:20m(boot),20m(kernel),1g(rootfs),-(user)
But the devicetree file(such as arch/arm/boot/dts/imx28-evk.dts) also sets
the same partitions as the kernel command line does.

In the current code, the partitions parsed out by the `ofpart` will
overwrite the @pparts which has already set by the `cmdlinepart` parser,
and the the partitions parsed out by the `cmdlinepart` is missed.
A memory leak occurs.

So we should break the code as soon as we parse out the partitions,
In actually, this patch makes a priority order between the parsers.
If one parser has already parsed out the partitions successfully,
it's no need to use another parser anymore.
