Subject: [PATCH 060/146] drm/i915: make sure we write all the DIP data bytes

commit adf00b26d18e1b3570451296e03bcb20e4798cdd upstream.

... even if the actual infoframe is smaller than the maximum possible
size.

If we don't write all the 32 DIP data bytes the InfoFrame ECC may not
be correctly calculated in some cases (e.g., when changing the port),
and this will lead to black screens on HDMI monitors. The ECC value is
generated by the hardware.

I don't see how this should break anything since we're writing 0 and
that should be the correct value, so this patch should be safe.

Notice that on IVB and older we actually have 64 bytes available for
VIDEO_DIP_DATA, but only bytes 0-31 actually store infoframe data: the
others are either read-only ECC values or marked as "reserved". On HSW
we only have 32 bytes, and the ECC value is stored on its own separate
read-only register. See BSpec.

This patch fixes bug #46761, which is marked as a regression
introduced by commit 4e89ee174bb2da341bf90a84321c7008a3c9210d:
    drm/i915: set the DIP port on ibx_write_infoframe

Before commit 4e89 we were just failing to send AVI infoframes when we
needed to change the port, which can lead to black screens in some
cases. After commit 4e89 we started sending infoframes, but with a
possibly wrong ECC value. After this patch I hope we start sending
correct infoframes.

Version 2:
  - Improve commit message
  - Try to make the code more clear
