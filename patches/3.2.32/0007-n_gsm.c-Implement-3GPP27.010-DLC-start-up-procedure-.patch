Subject: [PATCH 007/146] n_gsm.c: Implement 3GPP27.010 DLC start-up procedure
 in MUX

commit 7e8ac7b23b67416700dfb8b4136a4e81ce675b48 upstream.

In 3GPP27.010 5.8.1, it defined:
The TE multiplexer initiates the establishment of the multiplexer control channel by sending a SABM frame on DLCI 0 using the procedures of clause 5.4.1.
Once the multiplexer channel is established other DLCs may be established using the procedures of clause 5.4.1.
This patch implement 5.8.1 in MUX level, it make sure DLC0 is the first channel to be setup.

[or for those not familiar with the specification: it was possible to try
 and open a data connection while the control channel was not yet fully
 open, which is a spec violation and confuses some modems]
