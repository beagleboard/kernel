Subject: [PATCH 113/146] mm: thp: fix pmd_present for split_huge_page and
 PROT_NONE with THP

commit 027ef6c87853b0a9df53175063028edb4950d476 upstream.

In many places !pmd_present has been converted to pmd_none.  For pmds
that's equivalent and pmd_none is quicker so using pmd_none is better.

However (unless we delete pmd_present) we should provide an accurate
pmd_present too.  This will avoid the risk of code thinking the pmd is non
present because it's under __split_huge_page_map, see the pmd_mknotpresent
there and the comment above it.

If the page has been mprotected as PROT_NONE, it would also lead to a
pmd_present false negative in the same way as the race with
split_huge_page.

Because the PSE bit stays on at all times (both during split_huge_page and
when the _PAGE_PROTNONE bit get set), we could only check for the PSE bit,
but checking the PROTNONE bit too is still good to remember pmd_present
must always keep PROT_NONE into account.

This explains a not reproducible BUG_ON that was seldom reported on the
lists.

The same issue is in pmd_large, it would go wrong with both PROT_NONE and
if it races with split_huge_page.
