Subject: [PATCH 101/146] kbuild: make: fix if_changed when command contains
 backslashes

commit c353acba28fb3fa1fd05fd6b85a9fc7938330f9c upstream.

The call if_changed mechanism does not work when the command contains
backslashes.  This basically is an issue with lzo and bzip2 compressed
kernels.  The compressed binaries do not contain the uncompressed image
size, so these use size_append to append the size.  This results in
backslashes in the executed command.  With this if_changed always
detects a change in the command and rebuilds the compressed image even
if nothing has changed.

Fix this by escaping backslashes in make-cmd
