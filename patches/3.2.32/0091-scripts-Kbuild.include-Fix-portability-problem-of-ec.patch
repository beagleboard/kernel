Subject: [PATCH 091/146] scripts/Kbuild.include: Fix portability problem of
 "echo -e"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 875de98623fa2b29f0cb19915fe3292ab6daa1cb upstream.

"echo -e" is a GNU extension. When cross-compiling the kernel on a
BSD-like operating system (Mac OS X in my case), this doesn't work.

One could install a GNU version of echo, put that in the $PATH before
the system echo and use "/usr/bin/env echo", but the solution with
printf is simpler.

Since it is no disadvantage on Linux, I hope that gets accepted even if
cross-compiling the Linux kernel on another Unix operating system is
quite a rare use case.
