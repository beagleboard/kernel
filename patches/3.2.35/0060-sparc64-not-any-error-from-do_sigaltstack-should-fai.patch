Subject: [PATCH 60/90] sparc64: not any error from do_sigaltstack() should
 fail rt_sigreturn()

commit fae2ae2a900a5c7bb385fe4075f343e7e2d5daa2 upstream.

If a signal handler is executed on altstack and another signal comes,
we will end up with rt_sigreturn() on return from the second handler
getting -EPERM from do_sigaltstack().  It's perfectly OK, since we
are not asking to change the settings; in fact, they couldn't have been
changed during the second handler execution exactly because we'd been
on altstack all along.  64bit sigreturn on sparc treats any error from
do_sigaltstack() as "SIGSEGV now"; we need to switch to the same semantics
we are using on other architectures.
