Subject: [PATCH 82/90] can: bcm: initialize ifindex for timeouts without
 previous frame reception

commit 81b401100c01d2357031e874689f89bd788d13cd upstream.

Set in the rx_ifindex to pass the correct interface index in the case of a
message timeout detection. Usually the rx_ifindex value is set at receive
time. But when no CAN frame has been received the RX_TIMEOUT notification
did not contain a valid value.
