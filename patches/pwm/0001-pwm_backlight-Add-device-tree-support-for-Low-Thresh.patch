Subject: [PATCH 1/9] pwm_backlight: Add device tree support for Low Threshold
 Brightness

Low Threshold Brightness should be configured to have a linear relation
in brightness scale. This patch adds device tree support for low
threshold brightness as optional one for pwm_backlight.

+Low threshold support is required to have linear brightness scale from

+brightness changed from Low Threshold to Max in scales defined in
+brightness-levels. In this example 20% maximum brightness scale should
+be required to turn on panel backlight.
