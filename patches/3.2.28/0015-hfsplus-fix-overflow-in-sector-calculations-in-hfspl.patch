Subject: [PATCH 15/38] hfsplus: fix overflow in sector calculations in
 hfsplus_submit_bio
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit a6dc8c04218eb752ff79cdc24a995cf51866caed upstream.

The variable io_size was unsigned int, which caused the wrong sector number
to be calculated after aligning it. This then caused mount to fail with big
volumes, as backup volume header information was searched from a
wrong sector.
