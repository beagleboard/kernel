Subject: [PATCH 5/9] Codec sits on i2c3 bus when cape is connected to
 beaglebone LT. As a part of getting audio working on
 beaglebone LT, we first try with cape.

This patch adds i2c3 node and codec slave address.

Adapted from following patch by Gururaja Hebbar <gururaja.hebbar@ti.com>:

    On am335x-bonelt, codec TLV320AIC3x sits on i2c1 bus.
    This patch also add I2C1 node with I2C frequency and TLV320AIC3x Codec
    I2C slave address.
