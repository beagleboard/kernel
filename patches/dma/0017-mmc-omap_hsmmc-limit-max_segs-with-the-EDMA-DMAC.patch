Subject: [PATCH 17/29] mmc: omap_hsmmc: limit max_segs with the EDMA DMAC

The EDMA DMAC has a hardware limitation that prevents supporting
scatter gather lists with any number of segments. Since the EDMA
DMA Engine driver sets the maximum segments to 16, we do the
same.

TODO: this will be replaced once the DMA Engine API supports an
API to query the DMAC's segment size limit.
