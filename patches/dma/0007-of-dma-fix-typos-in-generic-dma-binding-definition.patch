Subject: [PATCH 07/35] of: dma: fix typos in generic dma binding definition

Some semicolons were left out in the examples.

The #dma-channels and #dma-requests properties have a prefix
that is, by convention, reserved for cell size properties.
Rename those properties to dma-channels and dma-requests.
