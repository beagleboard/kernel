Subject: [PATCH 2/4] of: Link platform device resources properly.

The resources of the platform devices created by the OF core were
not properly linked. Make sure that they are, so that we don't get
any crashes when trying to remove the device.

This commit is based on the previous commit of
"pdev: Fix platform device resource linking"
