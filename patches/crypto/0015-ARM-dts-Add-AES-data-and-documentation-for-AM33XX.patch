Subject: [PATCH 15/34] ARM: dts: Add AES data and documentation for AM33XX

Add the generic AM33XX AES module's device tree data and
enable it for the am335x-evm, am335x-evmsk, and am335x-bone
platforms.  Also add Documentation file describing the data
for the AES module.

+OMAP SoC AES crypto Module
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
+  AES versions:
+  - "ti,omap2-aes" for OMAP2.
+  - "ti,omap3-aes" for OMAP3.
+  - "ti,omap4-aes" for OMAP4 and AM33XX.
+  Note that the OMAP2 and 3 versions are compatible (OMAP3 supports
+  more algorithms) but they are incompatible with OMAP4.
+- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated with the AES odule
+- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the module
+- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
+  services interrupts for this module.
+- interrupts : the interrupt number for the AES odule.
+
+Optional properties:
+- dmas: DMA controller phandle and DMA request ordered pairs.
+- dma-names: DMA request names. This string corresponds 1:1 with
+	the ordered pairs in dmas. The string naming is to be
+	"tx" for TX request and "rx" for RX request.
+
+Example:
+	/* AM335x */
+	aes: aes@53500000 {
+		compatible = "ti,omap4-aes";
+		ti,hwmods = "aes";
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+		reg = <0x53500000 0xa0>;
+		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
+		interrupts = <102>;
+		dmas = <&edma 6
+			&edma 5>;
+		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
+	};
