Subject: [PATCH 08/34] ARM: dts: Add SHAM data and documentation for AM33XX

Add the generic AM33XX SHAM module's device tree data and
enable it for the am335x-evm, am335x-evmsk, and am335x-bone
platforms.  Also add Documentation file describing the data
for the SHAM module.

+OMAP SoC SHA crypto Module
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
+  SHAM versions:
+  - "ti,omap2-sham" for OMAP2 & OMAP3.
+  - "ti,omap4-sham" for OMAP4 and AM33XX.
+  Note that these two versions are incompatible.
+- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated with the SHAM module
+- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the module
+- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
+  services interrupts for this module.
+- interrupts : the interrupt number for the SHAM module.
+
+Optional properties:
+- dmas: DMA controller phandle and DMA request ordered pair.
+	Only one rx pair is valid per SHAM module.
+- dma-names: DMA request name. This string corresponds 1:1 with
+	the ordered pair in dmas. The string naming is to be
+	"rx" for RX request.
+
+Example:
+	/* AM335x */
+	sham: sham@53100000 {
+		compatible = "ti,omap4-sham";
+		ti,hwmods = "sham";
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+		reg = <0x53100000 0x200>;
+		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
+		interrupts = <109>;
+		dmas = <&edma 36>;
+		dma-names = "rx";
+	};
