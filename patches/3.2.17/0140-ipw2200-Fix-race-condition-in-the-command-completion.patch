Subject: [PATCH 140/165] ipw2200: Fix race condition in the command
 completion acknowledge

commit dd447319895d0c0af423e483d9b63f84f3f8869a upstream.

Driver incorrectly validates command completion: instead of waiting
for a command to be acknowledged it continues execution.  Most of the
time driver gets acknowledge of the command completion in a tasklet
before it executes the next one. But sometimes it sends the next
command before it gets acknowledge for the previous one. In such a
case one of the following error messages appear in the log:

Failed to send SYSTEM_CONFIG: Already sending a command.
Failed to send ASSOCIATE: Already sending a command.
Failed to send TX_POWER: Already sending a command.

After that you need to reload the driver to get it working again.

This bug occurs during roaming (reported by Sam Varshavchik)
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738508
and machine booting (reported by Tom Gundersen and Mads Kiilerich)
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/28097
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802106

This patch doesn't fix the delay issue during firmware load.
But at least device now works as usual after boot.
