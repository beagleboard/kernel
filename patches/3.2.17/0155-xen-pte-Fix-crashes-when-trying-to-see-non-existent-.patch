Subject: [PATCH 155/165] xen/pte: Fix crashes when trying to see non-existent
 PGD/PMD/PUD/PTEs

commit b7e5ffe5d83fa40d702976d77452004abbe35791 upstream.

If I try to do "cat /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables"
I end up with:

BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffc7fffffff000
IP: [<ffffffff8106aa51>] ptdump_show+0x221/0x480
PGD 0
Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
CPU 0
.. snip..
RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc00000000fff RCX: 0000000000000000
RDX: 0000800000000000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffffc7fffffff000

which is due to the fact we are trying to access a PFN that is not
accessible to us. The reason (at least in this case) was that
PGD[256] is set to __HYPERVISOR_VIRT_START which was setup (by the
hypervisor) to point to a read-only linear map of the MFN->PFN array.
During our parsing we would get the MFN (a valid one), try to look
it up in the MFN->PFN tree and find it invalid and return ~0 as PFN.
Then pte_mfn_to_pfn would happilly feed that in, attach the flags
and return it back to the caller. 'ptdump_show' bitshifts it and
gets and invalid value that it tries to dereference.

Instead of doing all of that, we detect the ~0 case and just
return !_PAGE_PRESENT.

This bug has been in existence .. at least until 2.6.37 (yikes!)
