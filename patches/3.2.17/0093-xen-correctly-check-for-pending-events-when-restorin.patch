Subject: [PATCH 093/165] xen: correctly check for pending events when
 restoring irq flags

commit 7eb7ce4d2e8991aff4ecb71a81949a907ca755ac upstream.

In xen_restore_fl_direct(), xen_force_evtchn_callback() was being
called even if no events were pending.  This resulted in (depending on
workload) about a 100 times as many xen_version hypercalls as
necessary.

Fix this by correcting the sense of the conditional jump.

This seems to give a significant performance benefit for some
workloads.

There is some subtle tricksy "..since the check here is trying to
check both pending and masked in a single cmpw, but I think this is
correct. It will call check_events now only when the combined
mask+pending word is 0x0001 (aka unmasked, pending)." (Ian)
