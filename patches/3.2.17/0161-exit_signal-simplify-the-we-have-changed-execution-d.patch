Subject: [PATCH 161/165] exit_signal: simplify the "we have changed execution
 domain" logic

commit e636825346b36a07ccfc8e30946d52855e21f681 upstream.

exit_notify() checks "tsk->self_exec_id != tsk->parent_exec_id"
to handle the "we have changed execution domain" case.

We can change do_thread() to always set ->exit_signal = SIGCHLD
and remove this check to simplify the code.

We could change setup_new_exec() instead, this looks more logical
because it increments ->self_exec_id. But note that de_thread()
already resets ->exit_signal if it changes the leader, let's keep
both changes close to each other.

Note that we change ->exit_signal lockless, this changes the rules.
Thereafter ->exit_signal is not stable under tasklist but this is
fine, the only possible change is OLDSIG -> SIGCHLD. This can race
with eligible_child() but the race is harmless. We can race with
reparent_leader() which changes our ->exit_signal in parallel, but
it does the same change to SIGCHLD.

The noticeable user-visible change is that the execing task is not
"visible" to do_wait()->eligible_child(__WCLONE) right after exec.
To me this looks more logical, and this is consistent with mt case.
