Subject: [PATCH 20/56] brcm80211: smac: pass missing argument to
 'brcms_b_mute'

[Not needed upstream --- this bug is specific to 3.2.y.]

Commit c6c44893c864, which removes the flag argument from brcms_b_mute,
is not part of 3.2.y, and we forgot to adjust a new call accordingly
when applying commit badc4f07622f ("brcm80211: smac: resume transmit
fifo upon receiving frames").

 drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/main.c: In function 'brcms_c_recvctl':
 drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/main.c:7882:4: error: too few arguments to function 'brcms_b_mute'
 drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/main.c:2538:13: note: declared here

Earlier build tests missed this because they didn't include this driver
due to 'depends on BCMA=n'.
