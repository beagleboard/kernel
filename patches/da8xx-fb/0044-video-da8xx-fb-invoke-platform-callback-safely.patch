Subject: [PATCH 44/48] video: da8xx-fb: invoke platform callback safely

Ensure that platform data is present before checking whether platform
callback is present (the one used to control backlight). So far this
was not an issue as driver was purely non-DT triggered, but now DT
support has been added.
