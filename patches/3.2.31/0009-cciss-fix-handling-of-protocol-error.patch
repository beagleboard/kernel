Subject: [PATCH 009/109] cciss: fix handling of protocol error

commit 2453f5f992717251cfadab6184fbb3ec2f2e8b40 upstream.

If a command completes with a status of CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR, this
information should be conveyed to the SCSI mid layer, not dropped
on the floor.  Unlike a similar bug in the hpsa driver, this bug
only affects tape drives and CD and DVD ROM drives in the cciss
driver, and to induce it, you have to disconnect (or damage) a
cable, so it is not a very likely scenario (which would explain
why the bug has gone undetected for the last 10 years.)
