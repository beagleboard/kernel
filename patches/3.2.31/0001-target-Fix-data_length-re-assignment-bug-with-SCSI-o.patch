Subject: [PATCH 001/109] target: Fix ->data_length re-assignment bug with
 SCSI overflow

commit 4c054ba63ad47ef244cfcfa1cea38134620a5bae upstream.

This patch fixes a long-standing bug with SCSI overflow handling
where se_cmd->data_length was incorrectly being re-assigned to
the larger CDB extracted allocation length, resulting in a number
of fabric level errors that would end up causing a session reset
in most cases.  So instead now:

 - Only re-assign se_cmd->data_length durining UNDERFLOW (to use the
   smaller value)
 - Use existing se_cmd->data_length for OVERFLOW (to use the smaller
   value)

This fix has been tested with the following CDB to generate an
SCSI overflow:

  sg_raw -r512 /dev/sdc 28 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

Tested using iscsi-target, tcm_qla2xxx, loopback and tcm_vhost fabric
ports.  Here is a bit more detail on each case:

 - iscsi-target: Bug with open-iscsi with overflow, sg_raw returns
                 -3584 bytes of data.
 - tcm_qla2xxx: Working as expected, returnins 512 bytes of data
 - loopback: sg_raw returns CHECK_CONDITION, from overflow rejection
             in transport_generic_map_mem_to_cmd()
 - tcm_vhost: Same as loopback
