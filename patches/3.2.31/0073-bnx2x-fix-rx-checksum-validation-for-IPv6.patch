Subject: [PATCH 073/109] bnx2x: fix rx checksum validation for IPv6

[ Upstream commit e488921f44765e8ab6c48ca35e3f6b78df9819df ]

Commit d6cb3e41 "bnx2x: fix checksum validation" caused a performance
regression for IPv6. Rx checksum offload does not work. IPv6 packets
are passed to the stack with CHECKSUM_NONE.

The hardware obviously cannot perform IP checksum validation for IPv6,
because there is no checksum in the IPv6 header. This should not prevent
us from setting CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.

Tested on BCM57711.
