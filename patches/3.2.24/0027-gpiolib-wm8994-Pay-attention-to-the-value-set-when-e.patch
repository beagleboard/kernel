Subject: [PATCH 027/109] gpiolib: wm8994: Pay attention to the value set when
 enabling as output

commit 8cd578b6e28693f357867a77598a88ef3deb6b39 upstream.

Not paying attention to the value being set is a bad thing because it
means that we'll not set the hardware up to reflect what was requested.
Not setting the hardware up to reflect what was requested means that the
caller won't get the results they wanted.
