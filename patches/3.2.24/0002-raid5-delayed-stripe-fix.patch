Subject: [PATCH 002/109] raid5: delayed stripe fix

commit fab363b5ff502d1b39ddcfec04271f5858d9f26e upstream.

There isn't locking setting STRIPE_DELAYED and STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE bits, but
the two bits have relationship. A delayed stripe can be moved to hold list only
when preread active stripe count is below IO_THRESHOLD. If a stripe has both
the bits set, such stripe will be in delayed list and preread count not 0,
which will make such stripe never leave delayed list.
