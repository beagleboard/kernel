Subject: [PATCH 037/109] PCI: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS
 computers

commit dbf0e4c7257f8d684ec1a3c919853464293de66e upstream.

Quite a few ASUS computers experience a nasty problem, related to the
EHCI controllers, when going into system suspend.  It was observed
that the problem didn't occur if the controllers were not put into the
D3 power state before starting the suspend, and commit
151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during
suspend on ASUS computers) was created to do this.

It turned out this approach messed up other computers that didn't have
the problem -- it prevented USB wakeup from working.  Consequently
commit c2fb8a3fa25513de8fedb38509b1f15a5bbee47b (USB: add
NO_D3_DURING_SLEEP flag and revert 151b61284776be2) was merged; it
reverted the earlier commit and added a whitelist of known good board
names.

Now we know the actual cause of the problem.  Thanks to AceLan Kao for
tracking it down.

According to him, an engineer at ASUS explained that some of their
BIOSes contain a bug that was added in an attempt to work around a
problem in early versions of Windows.  When the computer goes into S3
suspend, the BIOS tries to verify that the EHCI controllers were first
quiesced by the OS.  Nothing's wrong with this, but the BIOS does it
by checking that the PCI COMMAND registers contain 0 without checking
the controllers' power state.  If the register isn't 0, the BIOS
assumes the controller needs to be quiesced and tries to do so.  This
involves making various MMIO accesses to the controller, which don't
work very well if the controller is already in D3.  The end result is
a system hang or memory corruption.

Since the value in the PCI COMMAND register doesn't matter once the
controller has been suspended, and since the value will be restored
anyway when the controller is resumed, we can work around the BIOS bug
simply by setting the register to 0 during system suspend.  This patch
(as1590) does so and also reverts the second commit mentioned above,
which is now unnecessary.

In theory we could do this for every PCI device.  However to avoid
introducing new problems, the patch restricts itself to EHCI host
controllers.

Finally the affected systems can suspend with USB wakeup working
properly.
