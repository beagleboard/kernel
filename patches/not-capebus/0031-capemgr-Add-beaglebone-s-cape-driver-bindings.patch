+* TI Beaglebone DT Overlay Cape Driver
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible: "ti,bone-capemgr"
+
+- eeprom: Contains the phandle beaglebone's baseboard i2c eeprom.
+
+- baseboardmaps - node containing a list of supported
+	beaglebone revisions; each node in should have the
+	following properties:
+	- board-name: The board name stored in the baseboard
+		eeprom.
+	- compatible-name: The name which will be used for
+		matching compatible capes.
+
+- slots: node containing a list of slot nodes (which in the beaglebone
+	case correspond to I2C addresses for dynamically probed capes,
+	or an override slot definition for hardcoded capes.
+	- eeprom: Contains the phandle beaglebone's cape i2c eeprom.
+
+	It is possible to define override slots that will be activated
+	when the baseboard matches, and/or if supplied on the kernel command
+	line and/or when dynamically requested on runtime.
+	In that case the slot is marked with
+	- ti,cape-override: Marks a slot override.
+	- compatible: any of the "runtime", "kernel", or any compatible-name
+	  on a matching baseboardmap node.
+	- Any of the eeprom-format-revision, board-name, version, manufacturer,
+	  part-number, number-of-pins, serial-number, pin-usage, vdd-3v3exp,
+	  vdd-5v, sys-5v, dc-supplied properties which fill in the simulated
+	  cape's EEPROM fields. The part-number field is required, the rest
+	  are optional taking into default values.
+
+- capemaps: node contains list of cape mappings, which allow converting
+	from a part-number & version tuple to the filename of the dtbo file.
+	- part-number: part number contained in the EEPROM
+	- version node containing a
+		- version: specific version to map to
+		- dtbo: name of the dtbo file 
+
+Example:
+bone_capemgr {
+	compatible = "ti,bone-capemgr";
+	status = "okay";
+
+	eeprom = <&baseboard_eeprom>;
+
+	baseboardmaps {
+		baseboard_beaglebone: board@0 {
+			board-name = "A335BONE";
+			compatible-name = "ti,beaglebone";
+		};
+	};
+
+	slots {
+		slot@0 {
+			eeprom = <&cape_eeprom0>;
+		};
+
+		slot@1 {
+			eeprom = <&cape_eeprom1>;
+		};
+
+		slot@2 {
+			eeprom = <&cape_eeprom2>;
+		};
+
+		slot@3 {
+			eeprom = <&cape_eeprom3>;
+		};
+	};
+
+	/* mapping between board names and dtb objects */
+	capemaps {
+		/* Weather cape */
+		cape@0 {
+			part-number = "BB-BONE-WTHR-01";
+			version@00A0 {
+				version = "00A0";
+				dtbo = "cape-bone-weather-00A0.dtbo";
+			};
+		};
+	};
+};
+
+Example of the override syntax when used on a bone compatible foo board.
+
+{
+	...
+
+	baseboardmaps {
+		...
+		baseboard_beaglebone: board@0 {
+			board-name = "A335FOO";
+			compatible-name = "ti,foo";
+		};
+
+		slot@6 {
+			ti,cape-override;
+			compatible = "ti,foo";
+			board-name = "FOO-hardcoded";
+			version = "00A0";
+			manufacturer = "Texas Instruments";
+			part-number = "BB-BONE-FOO-01";
+		};
