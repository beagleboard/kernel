Subject: [PATCH 70/94] mm: hugetlbfs: correctly populate shared pmd

commit eb48c071464757414538c68a6033c8f8c15196f8 upstream.

Each page mapped in a process's address space must be correctly
accounted for in _mapcount.  Normally the rules for this are
straightforward but hugetlbfs page table sharing is different.  The page
table pages at the PMD level are reference counted while the mapcount
remains the same.

If this accounting is wrong, it causes bugs like this one reported by
Larry Woodman:

During fork(), copy_hugetlb_page_range() detects if huge_pte_alloc()
shared page tables with the check dst_pte == src_pte.  The logic is if
the PMD page is the same, they must be shared.  This assumes that the
sharing is between the parent and child.  However, if the sharing is
with a different process entirely then this check fails as in this
diagram:

  parent
    |
    ------------>pmd
                 src_pte----------> data page
                                        ^
  other--------->pmd--------------------|
                  ^
  child-----------|
                 dst_pte

For this situation to occur, it must be possible for Parent and Other to
have faulted and failed to share page tables with each other.  This is
possible due to the following style of race.

  PROC A                                          PROC B
  copy_hugetlb_page_range                         copy_hugetlb_page_range
    src_pte == huge_pte_offset                      src_pte == huge_pte_offset
    !src_pte so no sharing                          !src_pte so no sharing

  (time passes)

  hugetlb_fault                                   hugetlb_fault
    huge_pte_alloc                                  huge_pte_alloc
      huge_pmd_share                                 huge_pmd_share
        LOCK(i_mmap_mutex)
        find nothing, no sharing
        UNLOCK(i_mmap_mutex)
                                                      LOCK(i_mmap_mutex)
                                                      find nothing, no sharing
                                                      UNLOCK(i_mmap_mutex)
      pmd_alloc                                       pmd_alloc
      LOCK(instantiation_mutex)
      fault
      UNLOCK(instantiation_mutex)
                                                  LOCK(instantiation_mutex)
                                                  fault
                                                  UNLOCK(instantiation_mutex)

These two processes are not poing to the same data page but are not
sharing page tables because the opportunity was missed.  When either
process later forks, the src_pte == dst pte is potentially insufficient.
As the check falls through, the wrong PTE information is copied in
(harmless but wrong) and the mapcount is bumped for a page mapped by a
shared page table leading to the BUG_ON.

This patch addresses the issue by moving pmd_alloc into huge_pmd_share
which guarantees that the shared pud is populated in the same critical
section as pmd.  This also means that huge_pte_offset test in
huge_pmd_share is serialized correctly now which in turn means that the
success of the sharing will be higher as the racing tasks see the pud
and pmd populated together.

Race identified and changelog written mostly by Mel Gorman.
