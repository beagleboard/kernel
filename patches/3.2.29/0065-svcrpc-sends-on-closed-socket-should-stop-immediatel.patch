Subject: [PATCH 65/94] svcrpc: sends on closed socket should stop immediately

commit f06f00a24d76e168ecb38d352126fd203937b601 upstream.

svc_tcp_sendto sets XPT_CLOSE if we fail to transmit the entire reply.
However, the XPT_CLOSE won't be acted on immediately.  Meanwhile other
threads could send further replies before the socket is really shut
down.  This can manifest as data corruption: for example, if a truncated
read reply is followed by another rpc reply, that second reply will look
to the client like further read data.

Symptoms were data corruption preceded by svc_tcp_sendto logging
something like

	kernel: rpc-srv/tcp: nfsd: sent only 963696 when sending 1048708 bytes - shutting down socket
