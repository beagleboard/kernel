Subject: [PATCH 43/68] fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when
 fcaps are used

commit d52fc5dde171f030170a6cb78034d166b13c9445 upstream.

If a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous
personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared.
Thus programs given priviledge with fcaps will continue to have address space
randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it
easier to attack.
