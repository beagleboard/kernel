Subject: [PATCH 14/69] ia64: fix futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()

commit c76f39bddb84f93f70a5520d9253ec0317bec216 upstream.

Michel Lespinasse cleaned up the futex calling conventions in commit
37a9d912b24f ("futex: Sanitize cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API").

But the ia64 implementation was subtly broken.  Gcc does not know that
register "r8" will be updated by the fault handler if the cmpxchg
instruction takes an exception.  So it feels safe in letting the
initialization of r8 slide to after the cmpxchg.  Result: we always
return 0 whether the user address faulted or not.

Fix by moving the initialization of r8 into the __asm__ code so gcc
won't move it.
