Subject: [PATCH 44/68] ath9k: fix max noise floor threshold

commit 2ee0a07028d2cde6e131b73f029dae2b93c50f3a upstream.

Currently the maximum noise floor limit is set as too high (-60dB). The
assumption of having a higher threshold limit is that it would help
de-sensitize the receiver (reduce phy errors) from continuous
interference. But when we have a bursty interference where there are
collisions and then free air time and if the receiver is desensitized too
much, it will miss the normal packets too. Lets make use of chips
specific min, nom and max limits always. This patch helps to improve the
connection stability in congested networks.
