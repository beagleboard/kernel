Subject: [PATCH 05/30] ARM: OMAP: AM33XX: PM: Wait correctly for the PLLs to
 relock in the sleep code

The PLL relock code was incorrectly exiting the loop
before the PLLs relock. Since the PLLs relock within
a couple of A8 assembly instruction execution this went
unnoticed till now. The issue was noticed when validating
the abort path of the suspend process wherein the
incorrect check for PLL relock resulted in a lockup.
