Subject: [PATCH 035/171] mm: highmem: export kmap_to_page for modules

commit f0263d2d222e9e25f2587e51a9dc58c6fb2a9352 upstream.

Some virtio device drivers (9p) need to translate high virtual addresses
to physical addresses, which are inserted into the virtqueue for
processing by userspace.

This patch exports the kmap_to_page symbol, so that the affected drivers
can be compiled as modules.
