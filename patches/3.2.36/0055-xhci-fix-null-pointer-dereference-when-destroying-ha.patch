Subject: [PATCH 055/171] xhci: fix null-pointer dereference when destroying
 half-built segment rings

commit 68e5254adb88bede68285f11fb442a4d34fb550c upstream.

xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring() builds a list of xhci_segments and links
the tail to head at the end (forming a ring). When it bails out for OOM
reasons half-way through, it tries to destroy its half-built list with
xhci_free_segments_for_ring(), even though it is not a ring yet. This
causes a null-pointer dereference upon hitting the last element.

Furthermore, one of its callers (xhci_ring_alloc()) mistakenly believes
the output parameters to be valid upon this kind of OOM failure, and
calls xhci_ring_free() on them. Since the (incomplete) list/ring should
already be destroyed in that case, this would lead to a use after free.

This patch fixes those issues by having xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring()
destroy its half-built, non-circular list manually and destroying the
invalid struct xhci_ring in xhci_ring_alloc() with a plain kfree().

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
contains the commit 0ebbab37422315a5d0cb29792271085bafdf38c0 "USB: xhci:
Ring allocation and initialization."

A separate patch will need to be developed for kernels older than 3.4,
since the ring allocation code was refactored in that kernel.

[bwh: Backported to 3.2:
 - Adjust context
 - Since segment allocation is done directly in xhci_ring_alloc(), walk
   the list starting from ring->first_seg when freeing]
