Subject: [PATCH 57/57] CHROMIUM: Input: atmel_mxt_ts - Set T9 in mxt_resume
 based on lid state

This is an x86 specific change for the short term.
When the lid is closed on resume, make sure T9 is disabled.
to prevent the lid from affecting the touch device and causing
stray touches. If lid is open, restore operational settings for T9.

Signed-off-by: Benson Leung <bleung@chromium.org>

BUG=chrome-os-partner:17465
TEST=Close the lid to suspend in guest mode.
Open the lid slowly, until you see the lights indicating resuming.
Close the lid immediately upon seeing the system resume from
the status light.
The system should stay in S0. Check via ssh:
cat /sys/kernel/debug/atmel_mxt_ts/2-004a/object
Check that T9 is 0x00.
On a normal suspend/resume, where the lid is opened,
check that touch device is functional.
