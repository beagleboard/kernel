Subject: [PATCH 10/57] CHROMIUM: Input: atmel_mxt_ts - change MXT_BOOT_LOW to
 0x26

Changed to support address on new part. This is contrary to
Atmel documentation, and we are still working with them
to clear up this inconsistency. In the meantime,
change it for now to allow existing systems to update.

BUG=chrome-os-partner:8734
TEST=Firmware update works.
