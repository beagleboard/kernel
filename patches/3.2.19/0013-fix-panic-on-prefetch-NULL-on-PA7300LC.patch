Subject: [PATCH 013/117] fix panic on prefetch(NULL) on PA7300LC

commit b3cb8674811d1851bbf1486a73d62b90c119b994 upstream.

Due to an errata, the PA7300LC generates a TLB miss interruption even on the
prefetch instruction.  This means that prefetch(NULL), which is supposed to be
a nop on linux actually generates a NULL deref fault.  Fix this by testing the
address of prefetch against NULL before doing the prefetch.
