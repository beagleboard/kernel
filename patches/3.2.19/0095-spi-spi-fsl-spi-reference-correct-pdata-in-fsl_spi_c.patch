Subject: [PATCH 095/117] spi/spi-fsl-spi: reference correct pdata in
 fsl_spi_cs_control

commit 067aa4815a9bc12a569d8a06afef50ba5773afbf upstream.

Commit 178db7d3, "spi: Fix device unregistration when unregistering
the bus master", changed spi device initialization of dev.parent pointer
to be the master's device pointer instead of his parent.

This introduced a bug in spi-fsl-spi, since its usage of spi device
pointer was not updated accordingly. This was later fixed by commit
5039a86, "spi/mpc83xx: fix NULL pdata dereference bug", but it missed
another spot on fsl_spi_cs_control function where we also need to update
usage of spi device pointer. This change address that.
