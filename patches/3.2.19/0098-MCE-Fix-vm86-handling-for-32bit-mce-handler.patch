Subject: [PATCH 098/117] MCE: Fix vm86 handling for 32bit mce handler

commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.

When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
possible.

Fix this by always forcing vm86 to look like ring 3.
