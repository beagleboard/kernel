Subject: [PATCH 073/117] ARM: 7409/1: Do not call flush_cache_user_range with
 mmap_sem held

commit 435a7ef52db7d86e67a009b36cac1457f8972391 upstream.

We can't be holding the mmap_sem while calling flush_cache_user_range
because the flush can fault. If we fault on a user address, the
page fault handler will try to take mmap_sem again. Since both places
acquire the read lock, most of the time it succeeds. However, if another
thread tries to acquire the write lock on the mmap_sem (e.g. mmap) in
between the call to flush_cache_user_range and the fault, the down_read
in do_page_fault will deadlock.

[will: removed drop of vma parameter as already queued by rmk (7365/1)]
