Subject: [PATCH 057/117] USB: cdc-wdm: cannot use dev_printk when device is
 gone
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 6b0b79d38806481c1c8fffa7c5842f3c83679a42 upstream.

We cannot dereference a removed USB interface for
dev_printk. Use pr_debug instead where necessary.

Flush errors are expected if device is unplugged and are
therefore best ingored at this point.

Move the kill_urbs() call in wdm_release with dev_dbg()
for the non disconnect, as we know it has already been
called if WDM_DISCONNECTING is set.  This does not
actually fix anything, but keeps the code more consistent.
