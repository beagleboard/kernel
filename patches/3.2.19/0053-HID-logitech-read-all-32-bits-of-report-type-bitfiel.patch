Subject: [PATCH 053/117] HID: logitech: read all 32 bits of report type
 bitfield

commit 44d27f7dfedd9aadc082cda31462f6600f56e4ec upstream.

On big-endian systems (e.g., Apple PowerBook), trying to use a
logitech wireless mouse with the Logitech Unifying Receiver does not
work with v3.2 and later kernels.  The device doesn't show up in
/dev/input.  Older kernels work fine.

That is because the new hid-logitech-dj driver claims the device.  The
device arrival notification appears:

	20 00 41 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

and we read the report_types bitfield (02 00 00 00) to find out what
kind of device it is.  Unfortunately the driver only reads the first 8
bits and treats that value as a 32-bit little-endian number, so on a
powerpc the report type seems to be 0x02000000 and is not recognized.

Even on little-endian machines, connecting a media center remote
control (report type 00 01 00 00) with this driver loaded would
presumably fail for the same reason.

Fix both problems by using get_unaligned_le32() to read all four
bytes, which is a little clearer anyway.  After this change, the
wireless mouse works on Hugo's PowerBook again.

Based on a patch by Nestor Lopez Casado.
