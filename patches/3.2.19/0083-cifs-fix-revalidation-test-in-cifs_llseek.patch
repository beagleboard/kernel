Subject: [PATCH 083/117] cifs: fix revalidation test in cifs_llseek()

commit 48a5730e5b71201e226ff06e245bf308feba5f10 upstream.

This test is always true so it means we revalidate the length every
time, which generates more network traffic.  When it is SEEK_SET or
SEEK_CUR, then we don't need to revalidate.
