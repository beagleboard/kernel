Subject: [PATCH 017/117] hpsa: Fix problem with MSA2xxx devices

commit 9bc3711cbb67ac620bf09b4a147cbab45b2c36c0 upstream.

Upgraded firmware on Smart Array P7xx (and some others) made them show up as
SCSI revision 5 devices and this caused the driver to fail to map MSA2xxx
logical drives to the correct bus/target/lun.  A symptom of this would be that
the target ID of the logical drives as presented by the external storage array
is ignored, and all such logical drives are assigned to target zero,
differentiated only by LUN.  Some multipath software reportedly does not deal
well with this behavior, failing to recognize different paths to the same
device as such.
