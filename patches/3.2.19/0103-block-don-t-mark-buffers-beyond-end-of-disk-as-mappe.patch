Subject: [PATCH 103/117] block: don't mark buffers beyond end of disk as
 mapped

commit 080399aaaf3531f5b8761ec0ac30ff98891e8686 upstream.

Hi,

We have a bug report open where a squashfs image mounted on ppc64 would
exhibit errors due to trying to read beyond the end of the disk.  It can
easily be reproduced by doing the following:

[root@ibm-p750e-02-lp3 ~]# ls -l install.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 142032896 Apr 30 16:46 install.img
[root@ibm-p750e-02-lp3 ~]# mount -o loop ./install.img /mnt/test
[root@ibm-p750e-02-lp3 ~]# dd if=/dev/loop0 of=/dev/null
dd: reading `/dev/loop0': Input/output error
277376+0 records in
277376+0 records out
142016512 bytes (142 MB) copied, 0.9465 s, 150 MB/s

In dmesg, you'll find the following:

Squashfs manages to read in the end block(s) of the disk during the
mount operation.  Then, when dd reads the block device, it leads to
block_read_full_page being called with buffers that are beyond end of
disk, but are marked as mapped.  Thus, it would end up submitting read
I/O against them, resulting in the errors mentioned above.  I fixed the
problem by modifying init_page_buffers to only set the buffer mapped if
it fell inside of i_size.

Cheers,
Jeff
