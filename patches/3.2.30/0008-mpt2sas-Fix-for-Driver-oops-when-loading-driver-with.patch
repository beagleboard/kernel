Subject: [PATCH 008/136] mpt2sas: Fix for Driver oops, when loading driver
 with max_queue_depth command line option to a very
 small value

commit 338b131a3269881c7431234855c93c219b0979b6 upstream.

If the specified max_queue_depth setting is less than the
expected number of internal commands, then driver will calculate
the queue depth size to a negitive number. This negitive number
is actually a very large number because variable is unsigned
16bit integer. So, the driver will ask for a very large amount of
memory for message frames and resulting into oops as memory
allocation routines will not able to handle such a large request.

So, in order to limit this kind of oops, The driver need to set
the max_queue_depth to a scsi mid layer's can_queue value. Then
the overall message frames required for IO is minimum of either
(max_queue_depth plus internal commands) or the IOC global
credits.
