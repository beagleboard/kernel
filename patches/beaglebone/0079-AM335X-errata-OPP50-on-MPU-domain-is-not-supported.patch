Subject: [PATCH 079/102] AM335X: errata: OPP50 on MPU domain is not supported

This patch implements a workaround for OPP50 erratum, Advisory
1.0.15 at http://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz360b/sprz360b.pdf

OPP50 Operation on MPU Domain is Not Supported. This issue seen with
reliability tests running on MPU. To minimize power consumption, the
ARM Cortex-A8 may be operated at the lower frequency defined by OPP50,
but the respective power terminal VDD_MPU must be operated as defined
by OPP100. So MPU OPP50 modified to <275MHz, 1.1V>.

Power consumption as seen on AM335x EVM:
OPP50  <275MHz, 0.95> - 40.5 mW
OPP50  <275MHz, 1.10> - 55.5 mW
OPP100 <500MHz, 1.10> - 98.5 mW

Based on the above data we can see 43mW power savings compared to
OPP100. This is the reason for keeping OPP50 alive instead of
shutting down completely.
