Subject: [PATCH 23/37] ARM: OMAP2+: Convert ONENAND to retrieve GPMC settings
 from DT

When booting with device-tree, retrieve GPMC settings for ONENAND from
the device-tree blob. This will allow us to remove all static settings
stored in the gpmc-nand.c in the future once the migration to
device-tree is complete.

The user must now specify the ONENAND device width in the device-tree
binding so that the GPMC can be programmed correctly. Therefore, update
the device-tree binding documentation for ONENAND devices connected to
the GPMC to reflect this.

Please note that this does not include GPMC timings for ONENAND. The
timings are being calculated at runtime.

There is some legacy code that only enables read wait monitoring for
non-OMAP3 devices. There are no known OMAP3 device issues that prevent
this feature being enabled and so when booting with device-tree use the
wait-monitoring settings described in the device-tree blob.

+Device tree bindings for GPMC connected OneNANDs
+
+GPMC connected OneNAND (found on OMAP boards) are represented as child nodes of
+the GPMC controller with a name of "onenand".
+
+All timing relevant properties as well as generic gpmc child properties are
+explained in a separate documents - please refer to
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/ti-gpmc.txt
+
+Required properties:
+
+ - reg:			The CS line the peripheral is connected to
+ - gpmc,device-width	Width of the ONENAND device connected to the GPMC
+			in bytes. Must be 1 or 2.
+
+Optional properties:
+
+ - dma-channel:		DMA Channel index
+
+For inline partiton table parsing (optional):
+
+ - #address-cells: should be set to 1
+ - #size-cells: should be set to 1
+
+Example for an OMAP3430 board:
+
+	gpmc: gpmc@6e000000 {
+		compatible = "ti,omap3430-gpmc";
+		ti,hwmods = "gpmc";
+		reg = <0x6e000000 0x1000000>;
+		interrupts = <20>;
+		gpmc,num-cs = <8>;
+		gpmc,num-waitpins = <4>;
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		#size-cells = <1>;
+
+		onenand@0 {
+			reg = <0 0 0>; /* CS0, offset 0 */
+			gpmc,device-width = <2>;
+
+			#address-cells = <1>;
+			#size-cells = <1>;
+
+			/* partitions go here */
+		};
+	};
