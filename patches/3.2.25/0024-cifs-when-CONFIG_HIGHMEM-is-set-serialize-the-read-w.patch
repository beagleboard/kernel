Subject: [PATCH 24/73] cifs: when CONFIG_HIGHMEM is set, serialize the
 read/write kmaps

commit 3cf003c08be785af4bee9ac05891a15bcbff856a upstream.

Jian found that when he ran fsx on a 32 bit arch with a large wsize the
process and one of the bdi writeback kthreads would sometimes deadlock
with a stack trace like this:

Each task would kmap part of its address array before getting stuck, but
not enough to actually issue the write.

This patch fixes this by serializing the marshal_iov operations for
async reads and writes. The idea here is to ensure that cifs
aggressively tries to populate a request before attempting to fulfill
another one. As soon as all of the pages are kmapped for a request, then
we can unlock and allow another one to proceed.

There's no need to do this serialization on non-CONFIG_HIGHMEM arches
however, so optimize all of this out when CONFIG_HIGHMEM isn't set.
