Subject: [PATCH 230/291] sched/rt: Fix wait_task_interactive() to test
 rt_spin_lock state

The wait_task_interactive() will have a task sleep waiting for another
task to have a certain state. But it ignores the rt_spin_locks state
and can return with an incorrect result if the task it is waiting
for is blocked on a rt_spin_lock() and is waking up.

The rt_spin_locks save the tasks state in the saved_state field
and the wait_task_interactive() must also test that state.
