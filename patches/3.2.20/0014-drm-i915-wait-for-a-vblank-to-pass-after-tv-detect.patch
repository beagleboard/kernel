Subject: [PATCH 14/86] drm/i915: wait for a vblank to pass after tv detect

commit bf2125e2f7e931b50a6c76ba0435ba001409ccbf upstream.

Otherwise the hw will get confused and result in a black screen.

This regression has been most likely introduce in

    drm/i915/tv: Poll for DAC state change

That commit replace the first msleep(20) with a busy-loop, but failed
to keep the 2nd msleep around. Later on we've replaced all these
msleep(20) by proper vblanks.

For reference also see the commit in xf86-video-intel:

    Fix TV programming:  add vblank wait after TV_CTL writes

    Fxies FDO bug #14000; we need to wait for vblank after
    writing TV_CTL or following "DPMS on" calls may not actually enable the output.

v2: As suggested by Chris Wilson, add a small comment to ensure that
no one accidentally removes this vblank wait again - there really
seems to be no sane explanation for why we need it, but it is
required.
