Subject: [PATCH 13/49] powerpc/kvm: sldi should be sld

commit 2f584a146a2965b82fce89b8d2f95dc5cfe468d0 upstream.

Since we are taking a registers, this should never have been an sldi.
Talking to paulus offline, this is the correct fix.

Was introduced by:
 commit 19ccb76a1938ab364a412253daec64613acbf3df
 Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
 Date:   Sat Jul 23 17:42:46 2011 +1000

Talking to paulus, this shouldn't be a literal.
