Subject: [PATCH 19/46] drm/nouveau/fbcon: using nv_two_heads is not a good
 idea

commit 9bd0c15fcfb42f6245447c53347d65ad9e72080b upstream.

nv_two_heads() was never meant to be used outside of pre-nv50 code.  The
code checks for >= NV_10 for 2 CRTCs, then downgrades a few specific
chipsets to 1 CRTC based on (pci_device & 0x0ff0).

The breakage example seen is on GTX 560Ti, with a pciid of 0x1200, which
gets detected as an NV20 (0x020x) with 1 CRTC by nv_two_heads(), causing
memory corruption because there's actually 2 CRTCs..

This switches fbcon to use the CRTC count directly from the mode_config
structure, which will also fix the same issue on Kepler boards which have
4 CRTCs.
